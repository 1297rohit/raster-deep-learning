# Frequently Asked Questions

1. What is python raster function? 

Python Raster Function(PRF) allows developers to create/develop custom raster functions 
using Python. You can implement image processing algorithms in ArcGIS through Python programming. 
Since most deep learning developers and data scientists use Python to train, interpret and deploy 
deep learning models. We build our deep learning platform on top of existing python raster function framework to integrate 
deep learning workflow into ArcGIS. You can get more information on Python Raster Functions from ArcGIS online help page and Esri Raster 
Function Github repository (Link: https://github.com/Esri/raster-functions).
