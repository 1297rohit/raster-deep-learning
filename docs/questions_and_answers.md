# Frequently Asked Questions

1. What is python raster function? 

Python Raster Function(PRF) allows programmers to create/develop custom raster functions 
using Python. You can write image processing algorithms in Python. You can get more 
information on Python Raster Functions from ArcGIS online help page and Esri Python Raster 
Function Github repository. Since most deep learning developers and data scientists use 
Python to train, inference and deploy deep learning models. We will build our deep 
learning platform on top of existing python raster function framework to integrate 
deep learning workflow into ArcGIS.
